## UI Customizaiton

### Simple
Customizing the UI in this way allows you to not have to worry about re-doing anything in the local scripts.

How you do it is up to you, just make sure everything is named the same and parented the same. All buttons should remain as button objects. 

### Advanced
So you want to do it in a advanced way? Then you need to know how to script.

First you should study the existing UI and local script, once you have done that you should have the knowledge to reproduce it in your own way. Good luck!

### Officially Supported GUI's
If you wish to publish your hub GUI to the public please DM me and we can add it to here.
